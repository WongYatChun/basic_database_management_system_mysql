# Chapter 1: Introduction to Database

## Definition:
---
**Database (DB)**: A large collection of **inter-related** data

**Database Management System (DBMS)**: databases + a set of programs that store and access the data

## 6 drawbacks of storing DB in file system:
---
1.   Difficulty in accessing data: need write a new program to do each new task
2.   Data Redundancy and Inconsistency: multiple file formats, duplication of information
3.   Data Isolation: multiple file formats, cannot change simultaneously
4.   Atomicity Problem: failures may leave the DB in an inconsistent state with partial updates carried out
5.   Concurrent access anomalies: uncontrolled concurrent accesses can lead to inconsistencies
6.   Integrity Problem: hard to manage appropriate code to enforce consistency constraints


## 3 Concepts Supported by a DBMS
---
1.  **Data Abstraction**
    -   3 levels of data abstraction:
        -   Physical Level: data strucutures (How)
        -   Logistic Level: relationship among data (what)
        -   View Level: describes only part of the entire DB
    -   Schema: describe the structure of the DB (type)
    -   Instance: the actual content of the DB (value)
2.  **Data Modeling**
    -   Describe data in a systematic way
    -   A collective tool for describing
        -   data
        -   data relationship
        -   data semantics
        -   data constraints
3.  **Database languages**
    -   Data Definition Language (DDL) : Create DB
    -   Data Manipulation Language (DML) : Select Data

## DB Overview
---
The functional components can be broadly divided into

-   **Query Processer**
    - DDL interpreter
      - Interpret DDL statements and record the definition in the data dictionary
    - DML compiler
      - Translate DML statements in a query language in to an evaluation plan
        - Evaluation plan: low-level instructions that query evaluation engine can understand
    - Query evaluation engine
      - Execute low-level instructions generated by the DML compiler

-   **Storage Manager**
    -   File Manager
        -   Manage the allocation of the space on the disk storage
    -   Transaction Manager
        -   Ensure the database remains in a consistent (correct) state despite system failures
    -   Authorization and Integrity Manager:
        -   Tests for the satisfaction of integrity constraints and checks the authority of users to access data
    -   Buffer Manager
        -   Fetch data from disk storage into main memory
        -   Decide what data to cache in main memory

-   **Disk Storage**
    -   Data file
        -   store the database
    -   Data dictionary
        -   store the metadata about the structure of the database, e.g. the schema of the database
    -   Indices
        -   provide fast access to data records
